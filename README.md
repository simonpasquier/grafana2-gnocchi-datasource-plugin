Implemented
===========

* Getting measures of a metric with the metric_id
* Getting measures of multiple resources with a search query and a metric name
* Getting measures of metric with the resource id and the metric name
* Getting measures from a cross aggregation query

Not yet implemented
===================

* Template query

Current Limitation
==================

Grafana doesnâ€™t allow to query two different servers when using the proxymode
So we are not able to query Keystone for a token and then query gnocchi.

In proxymode, we need to set a token and the Gnocchi url on the datasource

In directmode (Not work yet), we can use login/password and the Keystone url. 
Note that CORS must be enabled on Keystone and Gnocchi servers.
